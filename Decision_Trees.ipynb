        "Entropy, which is not to be confused with entropy from physics, comes from [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory). Information theory is based on probability and statistics, and deals with the transmission, processing, utilization, and extraction of information. A key concept in information theory is the notion of a bit of information. One bit of information is one [unit of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_information).\n",

        "We can represent a bit of information as a binary number because it either has the value **1** or **0**. Suppose there's an equal probability of tomorrow being sunny (**1**) or not sunny (**0**). If I tell you that it will be sunny, I've given you one bit of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also think of entropy in terms of information. If we flip a coin where both sides are heads, we know upfront that the result will be heads. We gain no new information by flipping the coin, so entropy is 0. On the other hand, if the coin has a heads side and a tails side, there's a 50% probability that it will land on either. Thus, flipping the coin gives us one bit of information -- which side the coin landed on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Entropy can be much more complex, especially when we get to cases with more than two possible outcomes, or differential probabilities. A deep understanding of entropy isn't necessary for constructing decision trees, however. If you'd like, you can read more about entropy [at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy).\n",

        "\n",

Then, **for each unique value v in the variable A**, we compute the number of rows in which A takes on the value v, and divide it by the total number of rows.

This approach usually involves more complexity than it's worth and doesn't improve prediction accuracy, but it's worth knowing about.\n",

        "To simplify the calculation of information gain and make splits simpler, we won't do it for each unique value. We'll find the median for the variable we're splitting on instead.

If the models' predictions for the same row are far apart from each other, we have high variance. Imagine this time that we take a random sample of the training data and create many models. If the models' predictions for the same row are close together but far from the actual value, then we have high bias.\n",
